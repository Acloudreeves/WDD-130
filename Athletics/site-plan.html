My website will contain the most popular athletic shoes from the biggest name brand sites all in one location, eliminating the need for long searches to find that perfect shoe for you.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        WHY THIS SITE?
       The visitors will come to my website because it is all in one place, there isn't another site that simply shows all the best shoes in one spot. LeBron 19s are on Nike.com, while the Curry Flow 9s by Steph Curry are on Under Armours website. 
       That's just one good example of how some of the best shoes require you to look on different websites, you can use sites like Goat or StockX sure, but the prices are higher and even you still need to have an idea of what you're looking for.
       The only reason visitors would not choose my site is because they can't buy the shoes there, however to address this I am including a hyperlink to the source site or one that matches the lowest price. 
       Even then the real attraction of the site is being able to see several of the best shoes all on one website, after seeing one you like amongst others and knowing its name you can then go find it anywhere.

      </ul>
      <h3>Players Shoes</h3>
      <p>
        QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE ANSWERED
     Any visitor should expect to see the sites purpose and know what the site provides - something simple like "The best basketball shoes all in one place!"
     Also the visitors should see clearly the following things about any given shoe on the site, 1: Full shoe name, 2: Player name(if applicable), 3: Brand name, 4: The source website(link included) and 5: Price.
     These could be questions visitors have about any shoe, and they will all be answered on the site. Also I think on some shoes having a short description would be very useful for the users. 
     Specifically for player specific shoes like the LeBron 19s having a short text box below stating that this is LeBron James 19th shoe that he has made with Nike, and currently the newest shoe by the "King". 
     He uses them during his games that he plays as part of the Los Angeles Lakers. 
     Another thing I would like to include in this short description box might be the most attractive qualities(or just things that are good to know)of each of the shoes,for example the Kevin Durant 15s get released soon and one of the best qualities of this shoe is its great traction specifically on indoor courts. 
     However it may be useful to know that this shoe is built for a thin 7 foot tall NBA all-star, so as with his past shoes, reviews say that the shoes are very thin and may not be a comfortable fit for people with wider feet.

      <h3>History of Lebrons</h3>
      <p>
        THE EVOLUTION OF SHOE
        20 years ago Lebron James was one of the first NBA players to start a long-term contract with a major company, Nike. But over the course of 20 years not only have these shoes been a massive hit for Basketball fans around the world, but they have
        shown how shoes can change and evolve drastically.

        The Lebron 1s were a staple, the beginning of something great. Back then even the style was something new and exciting. Although when we look back they look old in comparision with what we have now. Because new technology and materials have allowed for all sorts of 
        new additions to be added to shoes a decade later.

        After a decade of shoemaking, Lebron James could really make anything and have fans love it, and you can see the designs follow closely what the wearer intended, something vibrant, new, different, meant for a big player with explosive power. And the 10's delivered. Some reviews say that of all the shoes 
        from the Lebron 7's to 12's the 10's are easily the best, specifically when it comes to traction. 

        Now after almost another decade here we stand, the detail alone between the 3 shoes is a world of difference, the comfort as well is imcomparable. A limit in how far the creative or technological world can advance is not reaching an end, and the performance increase with each new shoe is still prominent.

        I mentioned this in another location but on the homepage some portion of the text will explain "why this site" which I did not include in the wireframe.
